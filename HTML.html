            <p>Author: Myk Eff</p>
            <p>"Linear narrative refers to forms of storytelling in which the events of the story are presented in a cause-and-effect sequence that the audience experiences in a predetermined order, as fixed by the medium. Interactive narrative, on the other hand, refers to forms of storytelling in which the audience has some degree of control over the order in which events are experienced, as they are able to make choices that affect the direction, and outcome, of the story."</p>

            <p>Author: Riane Cox</p>
            <p>“Inception VR” was inspired by the everyday worker or student who is in need of an escape from monotonous reality. How can we give them a shift in reality that may leave them with new perspectives?</p>

Quotidian places became constricting and the inability to move a daunting thought for many. Natural environments were some of the only available spaces for movement and exploration.
